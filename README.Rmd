## Overview

The decisionSupportExtra pacakge provide additional functions to the
decisionSupport package, particularly for facilitating expert elicitation for
complex systems modelling under uncertainity. For example, the package  provides
facilities for formatting the output generated by the
[make_CPT](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/decisionSupport/versions/1.103.8/topics/make_CPT) as input for
[cptable](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gRain/versions/1.3-0/topics/cptable). These can also be visualized (as plots) for
further examinations and other usage.
